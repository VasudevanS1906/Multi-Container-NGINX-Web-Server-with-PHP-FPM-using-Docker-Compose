# Multi-Container-NGINX-Web-Server-with-PHP-FPM-using-Docker-Compose

This project demonstrates how to set up a multi-container NGINX web server with PHP-FPM using Docker Compose. It showcases the power of containerization and the ease of deploying and managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose. 

The project defines two services in the Docker Compose configuration file: nginx and php. The nginx service uses the official NGINX Docker image to serve web content, while the php service utilizes the lightweight PHP-FPM Docker image with the Alpine variant. 

The nginx service listens on port 80 inside the container and is mapped to port 8000 (or any other assigned port) on the host machine, allowing access to the NGINX web server. The project includes an NGINX configuration file that serves files from the /var/www/html directory, mounted as a volume from the www directory on the host. It also includes a location block that forwards PHP file requests to the php service running on port 8000.

A sample PHP file (index.php) with the phpinfo() function is included to demonstrate the functionality. When accessing the application URL, the NGINX web server serves the index.php file and forwards it to the PHP-FPM service for execution, displaying the PHP environment information in the web browser.
